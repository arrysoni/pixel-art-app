## 🤓 Learning Goals

This project was built as part of my journey to learn React and frontend development from scratch. It helped me understand:

- Component architecture
- State management (`useState`)
- Grid layout with CSS Grid
- Modular design in React

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- ✏️ Drag-to-draw support
- 🧾 Export art as PNG
- 📦 Save/load canvas from localStorage
- 🔢 Dynamic grid sizes (e.g., 8x8, 32x32)
- 👾 Import pixel templates (e.g., hearts, emojis)
